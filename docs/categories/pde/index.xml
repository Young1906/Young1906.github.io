My first encounter with Calculus of Variation is one of my homework where we try to derive probablity density function of some distribution by the principle of maximum entropy.</description></item><item><title>Learning to solve heat equation</title><link>https://iamtu.dev/posts/heat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamtu.dev/posts/heat/</guid><description>Surveying numerical methods (finite difference methods) and physics-informed neural networks to solve a 1D heat equation. This post was heavily inspired by:
(Book) Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers - Standley J. Farlow for deriving closed-form solution. (Article) Finite-Difference Approximations to the Heat Equation (Course) ETH Zurich | Deep Learning for Scientific Computing 2023 for Theory and Implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Network. Introduction Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) is an exciting subfield of Machine Learning that aims to incorporate physical laws and/or constraints into statistical machine learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
