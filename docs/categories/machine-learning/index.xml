      <title>Expectation Maximization - EM</title>

      <description>Problem Given a statistical model \(P(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Z} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) = P(\boldsymbol{X} | \boldsymbol{Z}, \boldsymbol{\theta})\), which generate set of observations \(\boldsymbol{X}\), where \(\boldsymbol{Z}\) is a latent variable and unknow parameter vector \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\). The goal is to find \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) that maximize the marginal likelihood:
$$ \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}; \boldsymbol{X}) = P(\boldsymbol{X} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \int_{\boldsymbol{Z}}P(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Z} | \boldsymbol{\theta})d\boldsymbol{Z} $$
As an example for this type of problem, there are two (unfair) coin A and B with probability of head for each coin is \(p_A(H) = p \text{ and } p_B(H) = q\).</description>

      <title>Understanding Variational Inference</title>

      <description>This post is a note I take from while reading Blei et al 2018.
Goal:
 Motivation of variational inference Understand the derivation of ELBO and its intiution Walk through the derivation, some of which was skip the in original paper Implementation of CAVI  ELBO Goal is to find \(q(z)\) to approximate \(p(z|x)\)
The KL-divergence
$$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} KL[q(z)||p(z | x)] &amp;amp;= \int_z{q(z)\log{\frac{p(z|x)}{q(z)}} dz} \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$
However, this quantity is intractable to compute hence, we&amp;rsquo;re unable to optimize this quantity directly.</description>

      <description>Simulation Based Inference Imagine we have some black-box machine; such a machine has some knobs and levels so we can change its inner configurations. The machine churns out some data for each configuration. The Simulation-based inference (SBI) solves the inverse problem that is given some data, estimating the configuration (Frequentist approach) or sampling the configuration from the posterior distribution (for Bayesian approach). For a formal definition and review of current methods for SBI, see this paper.</description>
