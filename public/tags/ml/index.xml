(Article) Finite-Difference Approximations to the Heat Equation (Course) ETH Zurich | Deep Learning for Scientific Computing 2023 for Theory and Implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Network. Introduction Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) is an exciting subfield of Machine Learning that aims to incorporate physical laws and/or constraints into statistical machine learning.</description></item><item><title>Numerical methods for PDE</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/pde/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/pde/</guid><description>Outline

The goal is to find \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) that maximize the marginal likelihood:
$$ \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}; \boldsymbol{X}) = P(\boldsymbol{X} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \int_{\boldsymbol{Z}}P(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Z} | \boldsymbol{\theta})d\boldsymbol{Z} $$
As an example for this type of problem, there are two (unfair) coin A and B with probability of head for each coin is \(p_A(H) = p \text{ and } p_B(H) = q\).</description></item><item><title>Implementing Automatic Differentiation</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/auto-grad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/auto-grad/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
