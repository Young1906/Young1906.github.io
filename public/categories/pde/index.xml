An ODE is a differential equation where the independent variable and its derivatives are in one dimension.
$$ \begin{equation} F(x, f(x), f^{(1)}(x), f^{(2)}, \cdots f^{(n-1)}(x)) = f^{(n)}(x) \end{equation} $$
Where \(f^{(i)}\) is the \(i^{th}\) order derivative of \(f\). Initial value is a set of known value at \(x = 0\), namely \(f(0), f^{(1)}(0), f^{(2)}, \cdots f^{(n-1)}(0)\).</description></item><item><title>My calculus of variations crash course</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/variational_calculus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/variational_calculus/</guid><description>My goal for this post is to have a basic understanding of Calculus of Variations, so that I can be more comfortable with mathematics in NeuralODE paper, where the problem can be formulated as a optimization of a functional with ODE constraint (Adjoint State Method for an ODE).
My first encounter with Calculus of Variation is one of my homework where we try to derive probablity density function of some distribution by the principle of maximum entropy.</description></item><item><title>Learning to solve heat equation</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/heat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/heat/</guid><description>Surveying numerical methods (finite difference methods) and physics-informed neural networks to solve a 1D heat equation.
