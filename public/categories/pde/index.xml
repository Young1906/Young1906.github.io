My first encounter with Calculus of Variation is one of my homework where we try to derive probablity density function of some distribution by the principle of maximum entropy.</description></item><item><title>Learning to solve heat equation</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/heat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/heat/</guid><description>Surveying numerical methods (finite difference methods) and physics-informed neural networks to solve a 1D heat equation.
