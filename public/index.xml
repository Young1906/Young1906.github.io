Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Initial Value Problem A differential equation is differential equation is a relationship between function \(f(x)\), its independent variable \(x\), and any number of its derivative. An ODE is a differential equation where the independent variable and its derivatives are in one dimension.
$$ \begin{equation} F(x, f(x), f^{(1)}(x), f^{(2)}, \cdots f^{(n-1)}(x)) = f^{(n)}(x) \end{equation} $$
Where \(f^{(i)}\) is the \(i^{th}\) order derivative of \(f\). Initial value is a set of known value at \(x = 0\), namely \(f(0), f^{(1)}(0), f^{(2)}, \cdots f^{(n-1)}(0)\).</description></item><item><title>My calculus of variations crash course</title><link>http://localhost:53049/posts/variational_calculus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:53049/posts/variational_calculus/</guid><description>My goal for this post is to have a basic understanding of Calculus of Variations, so that I can be more comfortable with mathematics in NeuralODE paper, where the problem can be formulated as a optimization of a functional with ODE constraint (Adjoint State Method for an ODE).

The paper setups the problem into a dataset of \(T\) observations \((x_1, &amp;hellip; x_T)\) drawn from a true distribution \(p_d(.)\). We then try to approximate \(p_d\) by a parameterized function \(p_m(.;\theta)\). The estimator \(\hat{\theta}_T\) is defined to be the \(\theta\) that maximize function
