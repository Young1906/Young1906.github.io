## Convergence in probability

**Definition** a sequence $\\{X_n\\}$ of random variable converges in probability towards the random variable $X$ if for all $\epsilon > 0$

$$
    \lim_{n \leftarrow \infty} \mathbb{P}(|X_n - X| > \epsilon) = 0
$$

## Consistent estimator

## A statistic (singular) 
is any quantity computed from values in a sample which is considered fro a statistical purpose (estimating population parameter, describing sample, evaluating hypothesis).


## Sufficient statistics
A statistic is sufficient with respect to a statisticcal model and its associated unknown parameter if no other statistic can be 

A statistic $T(X)$ is sufficient if

$$
I(\theta; T(X)) = I(\theta; X)
$$
