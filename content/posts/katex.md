## Motivation

Every statistic course I ever studied start with Simple Linear Regression. A linear regression problem can be state as following

$$
\begin{aligned}
    y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) &= \sum_{j=0}^{M-1}{
        w_j \phi_j(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^\top \phi(\mathbf{x})
    }
\end{aligned}
$$

```python
def f():
    return
```
